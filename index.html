	                <p>The Issei (first generation) came to America for opportunities after the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate Regime. Although they faced many challenges, they worked tirelessly, taught their children duty, honor and responsibility, and laid the foundation for future generations to come. This picture book album is a tribute to those Issei Pioneers of the Salinas Valley and is meant to remember their lives, to ensure that their contributions and experiences will be remembered.</p>

                    <p>"This book is a lovely tribute to the enduring spirit of the early Japanese settlers in California. It is an important piece of history and allows us to begin putting faces and stories to a largely overlooked, but very beautiful piece of American history.</p>
                    <p>The contributions and patriotism of Japanese Americans, even in the face of the injustice of the internment camps during WWII is both impressive and inspiring.</p>
                    <p>I want to thank Mrs. Sakasegawa, all the organizers and contributors to the book, and the Japanese American community in general for sharing your stories and experiences; and for your steadfast determination to help America live up to her ideals. There are so many lessons to be learned from the Japanese American community, I hope that more people come to know and understand them through the continued dedication of individuals like Mrs. Mae Sakasgawa."</p>

                    <p>"Going through this book was a history lesson of the first Japanese in the area around Salinas. I have read many articles seen many pictures and saw many movies of the early Japanese but this book really put them all together. I looked at every picture and read every word, and learned a lot about their family, their hardships, their challenges and their successes. It's a wonderful picture history book with narrations of family, how life was and the work these Japanese did. This book brings to light Japanese businesses, Japanese in agriculture and the contributions they made by being the first to introduce some of the most popular produce in the Salinas Valley. You will see pictures of some of the sons of these pioneers who volunteered into the US Army during WW-II, joining the 442RCT, 100Bn and the MIS. Their story is an honorable story by it self. We are the benefactors of these pioneers. A must see and must read book to appreciate their life and ours. Thank you Mrs. Mae Sakasegawa for this wonderful book."</p>

                    <div>Issei ("first generation") is a Japanese language term used in countries in North America and South America to specify the Japanese people who were first to immigrate. Issei are born in Japan, their children born in the new country are referred to as Nisei (second generation), and their grandchildren are Sansei (third generation). All of them come from the numbers "one, two, three" in the Japanese language, as Japanese numerals are "ichi, ni, san."</div>
